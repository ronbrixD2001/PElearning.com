	<p><b>History of mathematics</b></p>
	<p>The history of mathematics deals with the origin of discoveries in mathematics and the mathematical methods and notation of the past. Before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, followed closely by Ancient Egypt and the Levantine state of Ebla began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the patterns in nature, the field of astronomy and to record time and formulate calendars.</p>
	<p>The earliest mathematical texts available are from Mesopotamia and Egypt – Plimpton 322 (Babylonian c. 2000 – 1900 BC),[2] the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian c. 1800 BC)[3] and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian c. 1890 BC). All of these texts mention the so-called Pythagorean triples, so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.</p>

All of these texts mention the so-called Pythagorean triples, so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.</p>
	<p>he study of mathematics as a "demonstrative discipline" began in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient Greek μάθημα (mathema), meaning "subject of instruction".[4] Greek mathematics greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.[5] Although they made virtually no contributions to theoretical mathematics, the ancient Romans used applied mathematics in surveying, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, bookkeeping, creation of lunar and solar calendars, and even arts and crafts. Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system and the first use of negative numbers.[6][7] The Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics through the work of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī.[8][9] Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.[10] Contemporaneous with but independent of these traditions were the mathematics developed by the Maya civilization of Mexico and Central America, where the concept of zero was given a standard symbol in Maya numerals.</p>
	<p>Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were translated into Latin from the 12th century onward, leading to further development of mathematics in Medieval Europe. From ancient times through the Middle Ages, periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in Renaissance Italy in the 15th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This includes the groundbreaking work of both Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the development of infinitesimal calculus during the course of the 17th century. At the end of the 19th century the International Congress of Mathematicians was founded and continues to spearhead advances in the field</p>
	<p><b>Addition</b></p>
	<p><b>Addition</b> is a mathematical operation that explains the total amount of objects when they are put together in a collection.

For example, let’s say that Jimmy has 2 apples and Laura has 3 apples, and that we want to find out how many apples they have together. By adding them together, we see that both of them combined have 5 apples (2 Jimmy’s apples + 3 Laura’s apples = 5 apples in total). As you can see, the addition is signified by the “plus sign (+)”.</p>
<p>Addition can also be used to perform operations with negative numbers, fractions, decimal numbers, functions, etc. There are several arithmetic properties that are typical for addition:</p>
<p><b>1. Commutative property</b></p>
<p><b>2. Associative property</b></p>
<p><b>3. Identity property</b></p>
<p><b>Subtraction</b></p>
<p>Subtraction is the arithmetic operation that is the opposite of addition. Subtraction is used when you want to know how many objects are left in the group after you take away a certain amount of objects from that group.

For example, Maggie has 5 apples. She gives 2 apples to her friend, Paul. How many apples does she have? She has 3 apples (5 apples that she had – 2 apples that she gave to Paul = 3 apples that are left to her).</p>
<p>As you can see, subtraction is determined by the “minus (-) symbol”. Subtraction can also be used to perform operations with negative numbers, fractions, decimal numbers, functions, etc.</p>
<p><b>Multiplication</b></p>
<p>Multiplication is the third basic math operation. When you multiply two numbers, this is the same as adding the number to itself as many times as the value of the other number is. Think of it like this: You have 5 groups of apples and each group has 3 apples. One of the ways you can find out how many apples you have is this one:

3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples = 15 apples in total

You can see that it is way too much work (especially if you have larger numbers), so you can use multiplication to solve this problem:

5 group of apples x 3 apples in every group = 15 apples in total

This could be even easier by using the table of multiplication.</p>
<p>Multiplication is signified with multiplication sign “x”, and it is often read as “times” or “multiplied by”. So if you had an expression like “3 x 4”, you could read it as “3 times 4” or “3 multiplied by 4”. In the other words, the expression of multiplication signifies the number of times one number is multiplied by another number.

$\ 3 * 4 = 12$  The number 3 is multiplied in this equation 4 times, and when you multiply 3 by 4 you get the number 12 as a result.</p>
<p><b>Division</b></p>
<p>Division is the fourth basic math operation. Basically, you can say that dividing means splitting objects into equal parts or groups.

For example, you have 12 apples that need to be shared equally between 4 people. So, how many apples will each person get? Each person will get 3 apples (12 apples / 4 people = 3 apples per person). The division is the opposite of multiplication:</p>
<p>$\ 3 * 4 = 12$</p>
<p><b>Basic math operations</b></p>
<p>The basic math operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Depending on the directions for the math problem, you may see different words:</p>
<p>Addition: adding, add</p>
<p>Subtraction: subtracting, subtract</p>
<p>Multiplication: multiplying, multiply</p>
<p>Division: dividing, divide</p>

<p>In mathematics when you perform computational actions, you must have in mind that there is a sequence that need to be respected in order to do calculations properly.

Addition and subtraction are first degree mathematical operations. Multiplication and division are second degree mathematical operations. This means:</p>
<p>For example:
$\ 18 – 2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20$  This only applies if there are no brackets in the equation. If there are brackets, we firstly resolve numbers in the brackets.</p>
